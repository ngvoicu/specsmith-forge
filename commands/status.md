# Spec Status

Show detailed progress of the active spec.

1. If `.specs/registry.md` does not exist, report "No specs yet" and suggest
   running `/specsmith:forge`.
2. Read `.specs/registry.md` and find the spec with `active` status.
3. If no active spec exists:
   - If specs exist, list them and ask which one to activate.
   - If no specs exist, suggest running `/specsmith:forge`.
4. Load `.specs/<id>/SPEC.md` for the active spec and parse all phases
   and tasks.
5. Show a detailed breakdown with explicit markers (`✓` done, `→` in-progress,
   `○` pending), plus exact progress (`X/Y` tasks), current phase, and current
   task.
