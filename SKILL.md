  Structured spec management for AI coding workflows. Converts ephemeral
  plans into persistent, resumable specs with phases, tasks, and progress
  tracking that survive across sessions. Use this skill whenever the user:
  exits plan mode (automatically offer to save the plan as a spec), says
  "resume" or "what was I working on", wants to switch between projects,
  mentions specs/phases/tasks, says "spec new/list/resume/status/pause/activate",
  says "forge", "research", "create a spec for X", "plan X",
  says "generate openapi", "update api spec", "create api docs", "openapi",
  or any workflow involving structured planning that should persist. Also
  trigger when the user starts a new session in a project that has a `.specs/`
  directory — check for an active spec and offer to resume.

# Spec Smith

Turn ephemeral plans into structured, persistent specs built through deep
research. Specs have phases, tasks, resume context,
and a decision log. They live in `.specs/` at the project root and work
with any AI coding tool that can read markdown.

Whether `.specs/` is committed is repository policy. Respect `.gitignore`
and the user's preference for tracked vs local-only spec state.

## Critical Invariants

1. **Single-file policy**: Keep this workflow in one `SKILL.md` file.
2. **Canonical paths**:
   - Registry: `.specs/registry.md`
   - Per-spec files: `.specs/<id>/SPEC.md`, `.specs/<id>/research-*.md`,
     `.specs/<id>/interview-*.md`
3. **Authority rule**: `SPEC.md` frontmatter is authoritative. Registry is a
   denormalized index for quick lookup.
4. **Active-spec rule**: Target exactly one active spec at a time.
5. **Parser policy**: Use best-effort parsing with clear warnings and repair
   guidance instead of hard failure on malformed rows.

## Claude Code Plugin

If running as a Claude Code plugin, slash commands like `/specsmith:forge`,
`/specsmith:resume`, `/specsmith:pause` etc. are available. See the
plugin's `commands/` directory for the full set. The `/forge` command
replaces plan mode with deep research, iterative interviews, and spec
writing.

## Session Start

If active-spec context was injected by host tooling, use it directly
instead of reading files. Otherwise, fall back to reading files manually:

1. Read `.specs/registry.md` to check for a spec with `active` status
2. If one exists, briefly mention it:
   "You have an active spec: **User Auth System** (5/12 tasks, Phase 2).
   Say 'resume' to pick up where you left off."
3. Don't force it — the user might want to do something else first

## Deterministic Edge Cases (Best-Effort)

| Situation | Required behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| `.specs/registry.md` missing | If `.specs/` exists, report "No registry yet" and offer to initialize it. If `.specs/` is missing, report "No specs yet" and continue normally. |
| Malformed registry row | Skip malformed row, emit warning with row text, continue parsing remaining rows. |
| Multiple `active` rows | Warn user. Pick the row with the newest `Updated` date (or first active row if dates are unavailable) for this run. On next write, normalize to a single active spec. |
| Registry row exists but `.specs/<id>/SPEC.md` missing | Warn and continue. Keep row visible in list/status with `(SPEC.md missing)`. |
| Registry and SPEC conflict | Trust `SPEC.md`, then repair registry values on next write. |
| No active spec | List available specs and ask which to activate or resume. |

## Working on a Spec

### Resuming

When the user says "resume", "what was I working on", or similar:

1. Read `.specs/registry.md` — find the spec with `active` status. If none, list specs and ask which to resume
2. Load `.specs/<id>/SPEC.md`
3. Parse progress:
   - Count completed `[x]` vs total tasks per phase
   - Find current phase (first `[in-progress]` phase)
   - Find current task (`← current` marker, or first unchecked in current phase)
4. Read the **Resume Context** section
5. Present a compact summary:

   ```
   Resuming: User Auth System
   Progress: 5/12 tasks (Phase 2: OAuth Integration)
   Current: Implement Google OAuth callback handler
   Context: Token exchange is working. Need to handle the callback
   URL parsing and store refresh tokens in the user model.
   Next file: src/auth/oauth/google.ts
   ```

6. Begin working on the current task — don't wait for permission

### Implementing

**After completing each task, immediately edit the SPEC.md file** to record
progress. Do not wait until the end of a session or until asked — update the
spec as you go:

1. Check off the completed task: `- [ ]` -> `- [x]`
2. Move `← current` to the next unchecked task
3. When all tasks in a phase are done:
   - Phase status: `[in-progress]` -> `[completed]`
   - Next phase: `[pending]` -> `[in-progress]`
4. Update the `updated` date in YAML frontmatter
5. Update progress (`X/Y`) and `updated` date in `.specs/registry.md`

**Update transaction (required order):**
1. Update `SPEC.md` first (status/task/phase/resume context).
2. Recompute progress directly from `SPEC.md` checkboxes.
3. Update the matching registry row (status/progress/updated).
4. Re-read both files to verify consistency.
5. If registry update fails, keep `SPEC.md` as source of truth and emit a
   warning with exact repair action for `.specs/registry.md`.

Also:
- If a task is more complex than expected, split it into subtasks
- Update resume context at natural pauses
- Log non-obvious technical decisions to the Decision Log
- If implementation diverges from the spec (errors found, better approach
  discovered, assumptions proved wrong), log it in the **Deviations** section

### Pausing

When the user says "pause", switches specs, or a session is ending:

1. Capture what was happening:
   - Which task was in progress
   - What files were being modified (paths, function names)
   - Key decisions made this session
   - Any blockers or open questions
2. Write this to the **Resume Context** section in SPEC.md
3. Update checkboxes to reflect actual progress
4. Move `← current` marker to the right task
5. Add any session decisions to the **Decision Log**
6. Update `status: paused` in frontmatter
7. Update the `updated` date

**Resume Context is the most important part of pausing.** Write it as if
briefing a colleague who will pick up tomorrow. Include specific file paths,
function names, and the exact next step. Vague context like "was working on
auth" is useless — write "implementing `verifyRefreshToken()` in
`src/auth/tokens.ts`, the JWT verification works but refresh rotation isn't
hooked up to the `/auth/refresh` endpoint yet."

### Switching Between Specs

1. Pause the current spec (full pause workflow)
2. Load the target spec
3. Set target status to `active` in its frontmatter and in `.specs/registry.md`
4. Resume the target spec (full resume workflow)

## Command Ownership Map

- `SKILL.md`: global invariants, lifecycle rules, state authority, and conflict
  handling.
- `commands/*.md`: command-specific entrypoints, prompts, and output shapes.
- If there is a conflict, preserve `Critical Invariants` from this file and
  apply command-specific behavior only where it does not violate invariants.

## Spec Format

### Frontmatter

YAML frontmatter with: `id`, `title`, `status`, `created`, `updated`,
optional `priority` and `tags`.

Status values: `active`, `paused`, `completed`, `archived`

### Phase Markers

`[pending]`, `[in-progress]`, `[completed]`, `[blocked]`

### Task Markers

- `- [ ] [CODE-01]` unchecked, `- [x] [CODE-01]` done
- Task codes: `<PREFIX>-<NN>` — prefix is a short (2-4 letter) uppercase
  abbreviation of the spec (e.g., `user-auth-system` → `AUTH`). Numbers
  auto-increment across all phases starting at `01`
- `← current` after the task text marks the active task
- `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` after the task code on unclear tasks

### Resume Context

Blockquote section with specific file paths, function names, and exact
next step. This is what makes cross-session continuity work.

### Decision Log

Markdown table with date, decision, and rationale columns. Log non-obvious
technical choices (library selection, architecture pattern, API design).

### Deviations

Markdown table tracking where implementation diverged from the spec:
task, what the spec said, what was actually done, and why. Only log
changes that would surprise someone comparing the spec to the code.

See `references/spec-format.md` for the full SPEC.md template.

## Forging Specs

When asked to plan, spec out, or forge work, follow the full forge workflow:
research deeply, then write the spec.

### Step 1: Deep Research

Scan the project and gather context before asking anything:

- **Project structure**: Map directories, patterns, tech stack (read
  package.json / Cargo.toml / go.mod / requirements.txt etc.)
- **Related code**: Find every file, function, component, route, model, and
  test that touches the area being changed. Read actual file contents.
- **Patterns**: How does the codebase handle similar things? What conventions
  exist for the area being modified?
- **Dependencies**: Relevant libraries, version constraints, build/CI config
- **Web research**: If the task involves unfamiliar tech or benefits from
  current docs, search for best practices, API changes, known pitfalls

Save findings to `.specs/<id>/research-01.md` with sections for
architecture, relevant code, tech stack, external research, and open questions.

### Step 2: Setup

1. Generate a spec ID from the title (lowercase, hyphenated):
   `"User Auth System"` -> `user-auth-system`
2. Initialize directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .specs/<id>
   ```
3. If `.specs/registry.md` doesn't exist, initialize it:
   ```markdown
   # Spec Registry

   | ID | Title | Status | Priority | Progress | Updated |
   |----|-------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
   ```

### Step 3: Write the Spec

Synthesize all research notes and decisions into a
SPEC.md. See `references/spec-format.md` for the full template. Include:

- YAML frontmatter (id, title, status, created, updated, priority, tags)
- Overview (2-4 sentences — someone reading just this should understand
  what's being built and why)
- Phases with status markers (3-6 phases is typical)
- Tasks as markdown checkboxes with task codes (`[PREFIX-NN]`)
- Resume Context section (blockquote)
- Decision Log with non-obvious technical choices
- Deviations table (empty — filled during implementation)

**Quality check before presenting:**
- Every task should be concrete ("Add verifyToken() to src/auth/tokens.ts"),
  not vague ("implement token verification")
- Phases should have clear boundaries and dependencies
- Each task should be completable in roughly one focused session

Save to `.specs/<id>/SPEC.md`. Update `.specs/registry.md` — set
status to `active`. Present the spec for review and adjust based on feedback.

**Phase/task guidelines:**
- Mark Phase 1 as `[in-progress]`, the rest as `[pending]`
- Mark the first unchecked task with `← current`

## Before Session Ends

If the session is ending:

1. Pause the active spec (run full pause workflow)
2. Write detailed resume context
3. Confirm to the user that context was saved

## Directory Layout

All state lives in `.specs/` at the project root:

```
.specs/
├── registry.md               # Denormalized index for status/progress lookups
└── <spec-id>/
    ├── SPEC.md               # The spec document
    ├── research-01.md        # Deep research findings
    ├── interview-01.md       # Interview notes
    └── ...
```

## Registry Format

`.specs/registry.md` is a simple markdown table:

```markdown
# Spec Registry

| ID | Title | Status | Priority | Progress | Updated |
|----|-------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| user-auth-system | User Auth System | active | high | 5/12 | 2026-02-10 |
| api-refactor | API Refactoring | paused | medium | 2/8 | 2026-02-09 |
```

**SPEC.md frontmatter is authoritative.** The registry is a denormalized
index for quick lookups. Always update both together — when you change
status, progress, or dates in SPEC.md, immediately mirror those changes
in the registry. If they ever conflict, SPEC.md wins.

## Listing Specs

Read `.specs/registry.md` and present specs grouped by status:

```
Active:
  -> user-auth-system: User Auth System (5/12 tasks, Phase 2)

Paused:
  || api-refactor: API Refactoring (2/8 tasks, Phase 1)

Completed:
  ok ci-pipeline: CI Pipeline Setup (8/8 tasks)
```

## Canonical Output Templates

Use these concise formats consistently:

**Resume**
```
Resuming: <Title> (<id>)
Progress: <done>/<total> tasks
Phase: <phase name>
Current: <task text>
Context: <one to three lines from Resume Context>
```

**List**
```
Active:
  -> <id>: <Title> (<done>/<total>, <phase>) [<priority>]
Paused:
  || <id>: <Title> (<done>/<total>, <phase>) [<priority>]
Completed:
  ok <id>: <Title> (<done>/<total>) [<priority>]
```

**Status**
```
<Title> [<status>, <priority>]
Created: <date> | Updated: <date>
Phase <n>: <name> [<marker>]
Progress: <done>/<total> (<pct>%)
Current: <task text or none>
```

## Completing a Spec

1. Verify all tasks are checked (warn if not, but allow override)
2. Set status to `completed` in frontmatter and registry
3. Update the `updated` date in both
4. Suggest next spec to activate if any are paused

## Archiving a Spec

Archive completed specs to keep the registry clean:

1. Set status to `archived` in frontmatter and registry
2. Research files (research-*.md, interview-*.md) in `.specs/<id>/` can optionally be deleted
   (the SPEC.md has all the decisions and context)

Specs can be archived from `completed` or `paused` status. To reactivate
an archived spec, set its status back to `active`.

## Deleting a Spec

To remove a spec entirely:

1. Delete `.specs/<id>/` (contains SPEC.md, research notes, interviews)
2. Remove the row from `.specs/registry.md`

This is irreversible — consider archiving instead if you might need it later.

## Cross-Tool Compatibility

The spec format is pure markdown with YAML frontmatter. Any tool that can
read and write files can use these specs:

- **Claude Code**: Full plugin support or skill via `npx skills add`
- **Codex**: Snippet in AGENTS.md or skill via `npx skills add`
- **Cursor / Windsurf / Cline**: Snippet in rules file
- **Gemini CLI**: Snippet in GEMINI.md
- **Humans**: Readable and editable in any text editor
- **Git**: Diffs cleanly, easy to track in version control

To configure another tool, run `npx skills add ngvoicu/specsmith -a <tool>`.

## Behavioral Notes

**Be proactive about spec management.** If you notice the user has been
working for a while and made progress, update the spec without being asked.
If a session is ending, offer to pause and save context.

**Specs should evolve.** It's fine to add tasks, reorder phases, or split a
phase into two as understanding deepens. Specs aren't contracts — they're
living documents that adapt as you learn more about the problem.

**The Decision Log matters.** When the user makes a non-obvious technical
choice (library selection, architecture pattern, API design), log it with
the rationale. Future-you resuming this spec will thank present-you.

**Don't over-structure.** A spec with 3 phases and 15 tasks is useful. A
spec with 12 phases and 80 tasks is a project plan, not a coding spec.
Keep it lean enough to parse and act on in one read.

**Respect the user's flow.** Don't interrupt deep coding work to update
the spec. Batch updates for natural pauses — task completion, phase
transitions, or session boundaries.
